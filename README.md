# Basic-Snake-Game
The snake game we all know, made with pygame\
There are commented out parts, they add a challange to the game (walls start closing in), yet I don't think anyone would like that.
## How to Play
Use ARROW KEYS to turn the snake to the desired direction. The snake can't move backwards.
Press the SPACE button to restart the game. 
## Requirements
pygame: `pip install -Iv pygame==2.0.1`
## The Story Behind
We were playing snake from the browser with a couple of my friends, trying to beat each other's best scores. Then one of them said that it was great that the apple never spawned inside of the snake and dared me to code the game, which I did.
